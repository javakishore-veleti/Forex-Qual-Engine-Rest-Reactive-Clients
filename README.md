# Forex-Qual-Engine-Rest-Reactive-Clients

A Spring Boot 3.5.x–based Forex Qualification Engine demonstrating three HTTP client strategies:

- **RestTemplate** — legacy blocking
- **RestClient** — modern Spring 6+ blocking
- **WebClient** — reactive, non‑blocking

Built for **production-grade benchmarking**, **observability**, **SRE-driven analysis**, and **high‑concurrency performance comparisons** across blocking and non‑blocking paradigms.

---

# 1. Business Workflow — Forex Qualification Pipeline

The API:

```
POST /api/fx/qualify?clientType=rest_client|rest_template|web_client
```

Triggers a multi-step workflow:

1. Customer validation
2. Promo validation
3. Product books retrieval
4. Market interest rate retrieval
5. Response assembly via `FxQualResp`

These are orchestrated via a clean **strategy pattern**:

```
FxQualRestTemplateImpl  → Blocking
FxQualRestClientImpl    → Blocking (new client)
FxQualWebClientImpl     → Reactive (Netty)
```

The workflow engine:

```
GenericQualWFExecImpl
```

executes the steps consistently across all three implementations.

#### 🔵 **Dimensions Notes for Client Strategy Latency Comparison**

This document explains the **four key dimensions** used in the *Client Strategy Latency Comparison Dashboard* and how each dimension maps to **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Jaeger**, and the **OpenTelemetry Collector**.


#### Dimension 1. URI Dimension

##### What It Represents
The API endpoint being invoked, such as `/api/fx/qualify`, `/customer/{id}`, `/promo/{code}`.

---

##### Prometheus
Micrometer exposes URI as a low-cardinality label:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{uri="/api/fx/qualify", ...}
```

✔ Prometheus automatically normalizes URI templates  
✔ Prevents metric cardinality explosion

---

##### Grafana
Use URI as a dashboard variable:

```
label_values(http_server_requests_seconds_count, uri)
```

Recommended panels:
- Latency per URI
- Throughput per URI
- Error rate per URI

---

##### Jaeger
Span attribute:

```
http.target = "/api/fx/qualify"
```

Useful for:
- Filtering traces by endpoint
- Comparing RestTemplate vs RestClient vs WebClient behavior

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Pass-through attribute:

```
attributes:
  - key: http.target
```

You may extend or rename these attributes before exporting.

---

#### Dimension 2. HTTP Method Dimension

##### What It Represents
The HTTP verb associated with the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

---

##### Prometheus
Micrometer exposes method label:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_count{method="POST"}
```

---

##### Grafana
Use as a variable:

```
label_values(http_server_requests_seconds_count, method)
```

Useful for:
- Latency by method
- Error rate by method
- Distinguishing heavy POST workloads vs light GET calls

---

##### Jeager
Span attribute:

```
http.method = "POST"
```

Allows SREs and developers to:
- Filter traces for slow POST downstream calls
- Compare blocking vs reactive performance
- Identify retry behaviors

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Method forwarded automatically:

```
attributes:
  - key: http.method
```

Can be enriched or transformed for consistency.

---

#### Dimension 3. Status Code Dimension

##### What It Represents
HTTP response status code (200, 400, 500).

---

##### Prometheus
Captured in:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_count{status="200"}
```

Recommended queries:
- `rate(...{status=~"5.."}[5m])` → server errors
- `rate(...{status=~"4.."}[5m])` → client errors

---

##### Grafana
Create panels:
- Error rate over time
- Error heatmap grouped by status

Variable example:

```
label_values(http_server_requests_seconds_count, status)
```

---

##### Jaeger
Span attribute:

```
http.status_code = 500
```

Useful for:
- Tracing root cause of 4xx/5xx
- Error correlation with downstream calls
- Latency vs status comparisons

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Forwarded as-is:

```
attributes:
  - key: http.status_code
```

Useful for routing:
- send 5xx traces to separate pipeline
- sample errors aggressively

---

#### Dimension 4. Downstream Service Dimension

##### What It Represents
The external system called in the workflow, e.g.:

- `customer-service`
- `promo-service`
- `product-service`
- `market-service`

---

##### Prometheus
Captured using custom metrics or via WebClient instrumentation:

```
http_client_requests_seconds_bucket{clientName="promo-service"}
```

You can also add:
```
downstream="customer-service"
```

---

##### Grafana
Recommended dashboards:
- Latency per downstream
- Error ratio per downstream
- Comparison of RestTemplate vs RestClient vs WebClient for each dependency

Query variable:

```
label_values(http_client_requests_seconds_count, clientName)
```

---

##### Jaeger
Span attributes:

```
peer.service = "promo-service"
net.peer.name = "customer-service"
```

Provides:
- Full dependency map
- Latency per downstream hop
- Comparing blocking vs non-blocking downstream behavior

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Dependency metadata is preserved:

```
attributes:
  - key: peer.service
```

Can be used for:
- routing traces per downstream
- exporting specific services to specialized backends

---

#### Summary

This document provides a production-ready breakdown of the **four primary dimensions** used in latency and performance analysis:

- **URI**
- **HTTP Method**
- **Status Code**
- **Downstream Service**

Each dimension is mapped clearly to:
- Prometheus labels
- Grafana dashboards
- Jaeger tracing fields
- OTel Collector attributes

This enables deep observability and expert-level SRE diagnostics.

Read more below on dimensions mentioned above on "Resource Saturation Dashboard"

#### 🔵 **Resource Saturation Dashboard — Human-Friendly Deep Explanation**

Saturation is one of the **Four Golden Signals of SRE** (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation).  
This dashboard helps teams understand **how close the service is to overload**, which directly affects latency, failures, and error budgets.

This section explains each metric in simple, practical language — suitable for developers, senior engineers, SREs, and technical managers.

---

##### Dimension 1. Tomcat Thread Pool Saturation

Tomcat is the inbound web server (for all REST controller requests).  
It uses a **thread-per-request** model, which means:

- Each request occupies one thread.
- Too many requests → thread pool fills → requests queue → latency spikes → timeouts happen.

### **🔹 `tomcat_threads_busy`**

**What it measures:**  
The number of Tomcat worker threads currently serving requests.

**Why it matters:**  
High thread usage means your service is approaching overload.

**Interpreting the value:**

| Usage Level | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **< 70%** | Healthy |
| **70–90%** | Warning — load increasing |
| **> 90%** | Critical — risk of timeouts & 5xx errors |

---

##### Dimension 2. Tomcat Connection Pool Saturation

### **🔹 `tomcat_connections_current`**

**What it measures:**  
The number of current open HTTP connections to Tomcat.

**Why it matters:**  
A rapid increase usually indicates:

- Traffic spikes
- Slow downstream dependencies
- Clients retrying aggressively
- Load-test or real production surge

**Signs of problems:**

- Increasing linearly → healthy scaling
- Sudden vertical spikes → bottleneck forming
- Flat at max → connection exhaustion

---

##### Dimension 3. Netty (WebClient) Event-Loop Saturation

The Spring WebClient uses **Reactor Netty** internally, which is **non-blocking** and uses a small number of event-loop threads.

### **🔹 `reactor_netty_request_pending`**

**What it measures:**  
Number of **in-flight WebClient requests waiting to be processed**.

**Why it matters:**  
This shows if your outbound HTTP traffic is overwhelming Netty’s event loops.

**How to interpret:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Low & steady** | Healthy reactive system |
| **Gradually rising** | Downstream slow / backpressure building |
| **Spiking rapidly** | Netty overwhelmed → expect timeouts soon |
| **Stuck high** | Hard saturation → failure cascade risk |

---

##### Dimension 4. JVM Resource Saturation

Saturation inside the JVM tells you whether memory or GC slowdowns are limiting throughput.

### **🔹 Heap Usage (%)**

**What it measures:**  
How much of your application memory is currently being used.

**Why it matters:**  
High heap = more GC = more application pause time.

| Heap % | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **< 70%** | Optimal |
| **70–85%** | Heavy memory load |
| **> 85%** | Critical — risk of GC thrashing / OOM |

---

### **🔹 GC Rate / GC Pause**

**What it measures:**  
Frequency and duration of garbage collection pauses.

**Why it matters:**  
Frequent GC pauses directly increase:

- API latency
- tail latencies (p95/p99)
- thread blocking

If GC pause spikes → your latency spikes.

---

### **🔹 Allocation Rate**

**What it measures:**  
How fast your application is allocating new objects.

**Why it matters:**  
High allocation = more GC work = reduced throughput.

**Expected behavior:**

- Blocking clients (RestTemplate/RestClient): moderate allocations
- WebClient/Reactive: higher short-lived allocations

---

#### Saturation Dimensions Summary Overview Table

| Area | Metric | What It Indicates | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Tomcat** | `tomcat_threads_busy` | Thread pool load | Predicts overload & timeouts |
| **Tomcat** | `tomcat_connections_current` | Incoming connection pressure | Finds spikes & retry storms |
| **Netty** | `reactor_netty_request_pending` | Event-loop & backpressure | Detects cascading failures early |
| **JVM** | Heap % | Memory pressure | Predicts GC bottlenecks |
| **JVM** | GC rate/pause | GC health | Impacts p95+ latency |
| **JVM** | Allocation rate | Object churn | Silent performance killer |

---

This dashboard provides a **complete saturation picture**, allowing teams to catch:

- Overload conditions
- Thread starvation
- Connection exhaustion
- GC thrashing
- Backpressure buildup

*all before they become outages.*

# 4. Expert Java Developers — Deep Technical Insights

For senior/principal Java engineers understanding concurrency, threading, and JVM mechanics.

---

## Threading Models

### **RestTemplate & RestClient (Blocking)**
- Thread-per-request model (Tomcat)
- Predictable and synchronous
- Higher thread usage under load
- Connection pool saturation is bottleneck

### **WebClient (Non-Blocking)**
- Event-loop system (Netty)
- Thousands of concurrent requests
- Requires:
    - Backpressure
    - Timeouts
    - Bounded concurrency
    - Scheduler control

---

## JVM & Concurrency Details

### Allocation & GC
- Reactive chains → many short-lived allocations
- Blocking IO → longer-lived objects + higher GC pressure

### CPU Behavior
- RestTemplate / RestClient → stable CPU
- WebClient → higher throughput but more context switching

### Thread Pools
- Blocking → Apache HttpClient/JDK HttpClient pools
- Reactive → event-loop workers + reactor connection pool

### Backpressure
- Must explicitly manage with WebClient
- Avoid unbounded concurrency

### Error Propagation
- Blocking → standard exceptions
- Reactive → error flows inside operator chain

---

# 5. Achieving Non‑Blocking Behavior While Using Tomcat

Even though the application uses **Tomcat as the main HTTP server**, WebClient remains entirely **non-blocking for outbound calls** via Reactor Netty.

## Breakdown

| Layer | Technology | Blocking? |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Inbound server | Tomcat | Yes |
| Outbound WebClient | Reactor Netty | No |
| DB operations (R2DBC) | Reactive | No |
| Business logic | App code | Mixed |

This is the **realistic production architecture** used by **Fortune 100 companies**.

---

# 6. Tomcat vs Netty Distinction

| Topic | Tomcat | Netty |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Role in this project | Inbound HTTP Server | Outbound HTTP Client (WebClient) |
| Model | Thread-per-request | Event-loop |
| Blocking? | Yes | No |
| Best for | Traditional REST APIs | High concurrency downstream calls |
| Used for request handling? | Yes | No |
| Used for WebClient? | No | Yes |

### Can you run both?

Yes — your project **already does**:

- `spring-boot-starter-web` → Tomcat server
- `spring-boot-starter-webflux` → Reactor Netty for WebClient

### Should you switch Tomcat → Netty for everything?

Only if:
- You want *full reactive end-to-end*
- You remove the servlet stack
- You rewrite controllers to return `Mono<>`

99% of enterprises keep **Tomcat + WebClient hybrid**.
