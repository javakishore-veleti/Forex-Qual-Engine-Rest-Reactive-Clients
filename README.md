# Forex-Qual-Engine-Rest-Reactive-Clients

A Spring Boot 3.5.x–based Forex Qualification Engine demonstrating three HTTP client strategies:

- **RestTemplate** — legacy blocking
- **RestClient** — modern Spring 6+ blocking
- **WebClient** — reactive, non‑blocking

Built for **production-grade benchmarking**, **observability**, **SRE-driven analysis**, and **high‑concurrency performance comparisons** across blocking and non‑blocking paradigms.

---

# 1. Business Workflow — Forex Qualification Pipeline

The API:

```
POST /api/fx/qualify?clientType=rest_client|rest_template|web_client
```

Triggers a multi-step workflow:

1. Customer validation
2. Promo validation
3. Product books retrieval
4. Market interest rate retrieval
5. Response assembly via `FxQualResp`

These are orchestrated via a clean **strategy pattern**:

```
FxQualRestTemplateImpl  → Blocking
FxQualRestClientImpl    → Blocking (new client)
FxQualWebClientImpl     → Reactive (Netty)
```

The workflow engine:

```
GenericQualWFExecImpl
```

executes the steps consistently across all three implementations.

# 2. Expert SREs — What Matters

This repo is designed to showcase the KPIs, SLIs, SLOs, and saturation metrics an **SRE cares about in real production environments**, especially at scale (50+ pods, 100k concurrent users).

## Critical Golden Signals

| Signal | What It Tells You | Metric Source |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Latency** | Client strategy comparison, degradation under load | `http_server_requests_seconds_*` |
| **Traffic (RPS)** | Load level & request distribution | `http_server_requests_seconds_count` |
| **Errors** | SLO adherence, downstream reliability | 4xx/5xx request counts |
| **Saturation** | Thread pools, connection pools, memory, CPU | JVM metrics, Tomcat metrics |

---

#### Dimensions Notes for Client Strategy Latency Comparison

This document explains the **four key dimensions** used in the *Client Strategy Latency Comparison Dashboard* and how each dimension maps to **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Jaeger**, and the **OpenTelemetry Collector**.


#### Dimension 1. URI Dimension

##### What It Represents
The API endpoint being invoked, such as `/api/fx/qualify`, `/customer/{id}`, `/promo/{code}`.

---

##### Prometheus
Micrometer exposes URI as a low-cardinality label:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{uri="/api/fx/qualify", ...}
```

✔ Prometheus automatically normalizes URI templates  
✔ Prevents metric cardinality explosion

---

##### Grafana
Use URI as a dashboard variable:

```
label_values(http_server_requests_seconds_count, uri)
```

Recommended panels:
- Latency per URI
- Throughput per URI
- Error rate per URI

---

##### Jaeger
Span attribute:

```
http.target = "/api/fx/qualify"
```

Useful for:
- Filtering traces by endpoint
- Comparing RestTemplate vs RestClient vs WebClient behavior

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Pass-through attribute:

```
attributes:
  - key: http.target
```

You may extend or rename these attributes before exporting.

---

#### Dimension 2. HTTP Method Dimension

##### What It Represents
The HTTP verb associated with the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

---

##### Prometheus
Micrometer exposes method label:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_count{method="POST"}
```

---

##### Grafana
Use as a variable:

```
label_values(http_server_requests_seconds_count, method)
```

Useful for:
- Latency by method
- Error rate by method
- Distinguishing heavy POST workloads vs light GET calls

---

##### Jeager
Span attribute:

```
http.method = "POST"
```

Allows SREs and developers to:
- Filter traces for slow POST downstream calls
- Compare blocking vs reactive performance
- Identify retry behaviors

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Method forwarded automatically:

```
attributes:
  - key: http.method
```

Can be enriched or transformed for consistency.

---

#### Dimension 3. Status Code Dimension

##### What It Represents
HTTP response status code (200, 400, 500).

---

##### Prometheus
Captured in:

```
http_server_requests_seconds_count{status="200"}
```

Recommended queries:
- `rate(...{status=~"5.."}[5m])` → server errors
- `rate(...{status=~"4.."}[5m])` → client errors

---

##### Grafana
Create panels:
- Error rate over time
- Error heatmap grouped by status

Variable example:

```
label_values(http_server_requests_seconds_count, status)
```

---

##### Jaeger
Span attribute:

```
http.status_code = 500
```

Useful for:
- Tracing root cause of 4xx/5xx
- Error correlation with downstream calls
- Latency vs status comparisons

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Forwarded as-is:

```
attributes:
  - key: http.status_code
```

Useful for routing:
- send 5xx traces to separate pipeline
- sample errors aggressively

---

#### Dimension 4. Downstream Service Dimension

##### What It Represents
The external system called in the workflow, e.g.:

- `customer-service`
- `promo-service`
- `product-service`
- `market-service`

---

##### Prometheus
Captured using custom metrics or via WebClient instrumentation:

```
http_client_requests_seconds_bucket{clientName="promo-service"}
```

You can also add:
```
downstream="customer-service"
```

---

##### Grafana
Recommended dashboards:
- Latency per downstream
- Error ratio per downstream
- Comparison of RestTemplate vs RestClient vs WebClient for each dependency

Query variable:

```
label_values(http_client_requests_seconds_count, clientName)
```

---

##### Jaeger
Span attributes:

```
peer.service = "promo-service"
net.peer.name = "customer-service"
```

Provides:
- Full dependency map
- Latency per downstream hop
- Comparing blocking vs non-blocking downstream behavior

---

##### OpenTelemetry Collector
Dependency metadata is preserved:

```
attributes:
  - key: peer.service
```

Can be used for:
- routing traces per downstream
- exporting specific services to specialized backends

---

#### Summary

This document provides a production-ready breakdown of the **four primary dimensions** used in latency and performance analysis:

- **URI**
- **HTTP Method**
- **Status Code**
- **Downstream Service**

Each dimension is mapped clearly to:
- Prometheus labels
- Grafana dashboards
- Jaeger tracing fields
- OTel Collector attributes

This enables deep observability and expert-level SRE diagnostics.

# 4. Expert Java Developers — Deep Technical Insights

For senior/principal Java engineers understanding concurrency, threading, and JVM mechanics.

---

## Threading Models

### **RestTemplate & RestClient (Blocking)**
- Thread-per-request model (Tomcat)
- Predictable and synchronous
- Higher thread usage under load
- Connection pool saturation is bottleneck

### **WebClient (Non-Blocking)**
- Event-loop system (Netty)
- Thousands of concurrent requests
- Requires:
    - Backpressure
    - Timeouts
    - Bounded concurrency
    - Scheduler control

---

## JVM & Concurrency Details

### Allocation & GC
- Reactive chains → many short-lived allocations
- Blocking IO → longer-lived objects + higher GC pressure

### CPU Behavior
- RestTemplate / RestClient → stable CPU
- WebClient → higher throughput but more context switching

### Thread Pools
- Blocking → Apache HttpClient/JDK HttpClient pools
- Reactive → event-loop workers + reactor connection pool

### Backpressure
- Must explicitly manage with WebClient
- Avoid unbounded concurrency

### Error Propagation
- Blocking → standard exceptions
- Reactive → error flows inside operator chain

---

# 5. Achieving Non‑Blocking Behavior While Using Tomcat

Even though the application uses **Tomcat as the main HTTP server**, WebClient remains entirely **non-blocking for outbound calls** via Reactor Netty.

## Breakdown

| Layer | Technology | Blocking? |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Inbound server | Tomcat | Yes |
| Outbound WebClient | Reactor Netty | No |
| DB operations (R2DBC) | Reactive | No |
| Business logic | App code | Mixed |

This is the **realistic production architecture** used by **Fortune 100 companies**.

---

# 6. Tomcat vs Netty Distinction

| Topic | Tomcat | Netty |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Role in this project | Inbound HTTP Server | Outbound HTTP Client (WebClient) |
| Model | Thread-per-request | Event-loop |
| Blocking? | Yes | No |
| Best for | Traditional REST APIs | High concurrency downstream calls |
| Used for request handling? | Yes | No |
| Used for WebClient? | No | Yes |

### Can you run both?

Yes — your project **already does**:

- `spring-boot-starter-web` → Tomcat server
- `spring-boot-starter-webflux` → Reactor Netty for WebClient

### Should you switch Tomcat → Netty for everything?

Only if:
- You want *full reactive end-to-end*
- You remove the servlet stack
- You rewrite controllers to return `Mono<>`

99% of enterprises keep **Tomcat + WebClient hybrid**.
